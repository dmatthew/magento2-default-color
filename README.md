# Magento 2 Default Color

A Magento 2 module for setting a default color by configurable product which gets preselected on category and product pages.

Out of the box, Magento allows you to set a global default color value which gets applied to all products. This module allows you to select which color option is the default for a configurable product. This allows site owners to better display certain colors for different products on their store. The default color will be preselected on category and product pages. When using the layered navigation on category pages, if the user has already selected a color to filter by, then that color will be used instead of the default color.
